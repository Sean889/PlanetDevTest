# PlanetDevTest
Testbed for planet rendering in other projects.

This is a testing area so that I can use the code for larger projects. 
The code should stay in working order but will probably change in random directions.

In the demo the controls are:
- W is forwards
- S is backwards
- A is left
- D is right
- Q is up
- E is down

Rotation is controlled by the I, J, K, L, U and O keys.
